# Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning models. It leverages historical data from Yahoo Finance and applies data preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to forecast future stock prices.

## Motivation

With the increasing volatility of stock markets, predicting future stock prices has become a valuable tool for both individual and institutional investors. This project is designed to build a reliable, easy-to-use web application that predicts stock prices using advanced machine learning algorithms. By making stock market prediction tools more accessible, the goal is to help users make informed decisions in their investments.

## Summary

The project includes a Streamlit web application for stock price prediction, powered by Python and machine learning libraries. The model utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance. Users can enter a stock ticker and visualize both historical trends and predicted future prices.

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` API.
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Stock price prediction using LSTM models from `keras` and `tensorflow`.
- Visualizes both actual and predicted prices using `matplotlib`.
- Interactive interface built with `Streamlit`.

## File Descriptions

1. **stock_prediction.py**: The main script that includes data fetching, preprocessing, model training, and prediction logic using LSTM models.
2. **requirements.txt**: The list of dependencies required to run the project, including libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, and `Streamlit`.
3. **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
    \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    \`\`\`bash
    cd stock-price-prediction
    \`\`\`

3. Install the required dependencies:

    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \`\`\`

4. Run the Streamlit app:

    streamlit run stock_prediction.py
    \`\`\`

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the application.

## Technologies Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **yfinance**: To fetch historical stock data.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting stock price trends.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: To build and train the LSTM model for stock price prediction.
